The goal of `daapr` is to conveniently provide the main packages used for 
implementing the framework of Data-as-a-Product (DaaP).

## Installation

**Read this section carefully!** 

`daapr` installs the core packages of the DaaP framework, 
[`dpbuild`](https://github.com/amashadihossein/dpbuild), 
[`dpdeploy`](https://github.com/amashadihossein/dpdeploy) and 
[`dpi`](https://github.com/amashadihossein/dpi), along with a custom version of 
the [`pins`](https://github.com/amashadihossein/pins) package.


Note: currently `daapr` uses a custom version of the 
`pins` package. This will change in the future to
stay in sync with the latest [`pins`](https://pins.rstudio.com/). However, 
at this point, it is important to
remove any existing packages and start with a fresh pull from this repo.

```{r remove_old_pkg, eval = F}
# Remove previously installed core daapr packages and update
remove.packages(intersect(rownames(installed.packages()), 
                          c("pins","dpi","dpbuild","dpdeploy","daapr")))
```

For released version

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github(repo = "amashadihossein/daapr")
```

For dev version

```{r install_dev, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github(repo = "amashadihossein/daapr", ref = "dev")
```
