The goal of `daapr` is to conveniently provide the main packages used for 
implementing the framework of Data-as-a-Product (DaaP).

## Installation

**Read this section carefully!** 

`daapr` installs the core packages of the DaaP framework, 
[`dpbuild`](https://github.com/amashadihossein/dpbuild)., 
[`dpdeploy`](https://github.com/amashadihossein/dpdeploy) and 
[`dpi`](https://github.com/amashadihossein/dpi), along with a custom version of 
the [`pins`](https://github.com/amashadihossein/pins) package.


```{r installation, eval = F}
# Remove previously installed packages and update
remove.packages(intersect(rownames(installed.packages()), 
                          c("pins","dpi","dpbuild","dpdeploy","daapr")))


# To install the dev version use dev reference as below
remotes::install_github(repo = "amashadihossein/daapr")

# To install the dev version use dev reference as below
remotes::install_github(repo = "amashadihossein/daapr", ref = "dev")
```
