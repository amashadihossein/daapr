# daapr 0.1.0

## Breaking changes

* daapr now requires pins >= v1.2.0 and dpi, dpbuild, dpdeploy packages have been updated accordingly. The daapr dependencies have been update to reflect these changes. 
* Forwards incompatibility: older data products build with custom/legacy pins are incompatible with daapr >= 0.1.0.
* LabKey functionality has been temporarily removed until pins v1 can be extended to support LabKey boards

## Other improvments

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
